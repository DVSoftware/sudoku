This game is made as a project for technical assesment for the job at Two Desperados. 

Since this is the first time I coded in C#, and almost first time I used Unity to make some game (i played with it when it first came out), I probably made some mistakes in regards of C# and Unity best practices.

The free assets were downloaded from OpenGameArt and itch.io.

Unity version used for this project is 2019.3.0f6 

## Known Issues
- There are sometimes board scaling issues on Android. I couldn't figure why it happens.
